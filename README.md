The Bit Shift Assembler for the 6502 / 65C02 / 45GS02 CPU.

The Assembler supports the address modes and instructions of the
45GS02 CPU as used in the MEGA65 computer.
All instructions using the pseudo 32 bit register are under construction
but will be implemented soon.

Instructions how to use the assembler are contained in the first pages
of the assembler source "bsa.c".
